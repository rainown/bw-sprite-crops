# bw-sprite-crops
Pokemon Showdown! Gen 5-styled sprites which have been cropped to each have an 8 x 8 pixel transparent border. Uploaded publicly on the odd chance that someone other than me happens to need them for whatever reason. All credit for the sprites goes to their respective creators. 
Some CAP mons and other sprites might be included by accident because they were also included inside of the PS! sprite indexes.
Some images also have a weird black background that wasn't removed by the batch crop. I'm manually removing them on an as-needed basis.
